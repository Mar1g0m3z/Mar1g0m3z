### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Marisela! From the dynamic world of social services as a Domestic Victim Advocate and correctional officer, I've transitioned into the logical and creative realm of software engineering. My journey through App Academy honed my skills in full-stack development, with a keen focus on JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL, igniting a perpetual love for learning and problem-solving.

🌐 I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant, user-centric solutions. My background has instilled in me not only technical proficiency but also invaluable soft skills like effective communication, empathetic leadership, and adaptability. These experiences make me a collaborative and resilient developer, ready to tackle challenges and contribute positively to any team.

✨ What captivates me most about software development is the endless potential for creativity—bringing designs to life, achieving pixel-perfect UI/UX, and crafting code that feels like magic. I aim to blend precision, innovation, and a continuous quest for improvement in every project I touch.

🎮 Outside of coding, you'll find me immersed in video games, rolling dice in DnD, or dreaming about surfing. I aspire to merge my passion for technology with creativity, particularly in the gaming industry, where I believe the most exciting projects lie.

🤝 I'm on a mission to bring my unique blend of skills, experiences, and passions to a team as committed to learning and innovation as I am. Let's make something incredible together.

Feel free to reach out or follow my coding journey here on GitHub!
